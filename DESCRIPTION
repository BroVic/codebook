Title: Automatic Codebooks from Survey Metadata Encoded in Attributes
Description: Easily automate the following tasks to describe data frames: 
  computing reliabilities (internal consistencies, retest, multilevel) for psychological scales, 
  summarise the distributions of scales and items graphically and using descriptive statistics,
  combine this information with metadata (such as item labels and labelled values) that is derived from R attributes.
  To do so, the package relies on 'rmarkdown' partials, so you can generate HTML, PDF, and Word documents. Codebooks
  are also available as tables (CSV, Excel, etc.).
